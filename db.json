The aim of the project was to develop and implement an embedded system aiming to automate and simplify a human action. The system uses a rain sensor to close or open the tarpaulins depending on the weather outside, a set of buttons for its manual operation and a mobile application for a remote control. For that I used a Raspberry Pi because I could use the multi‑Threading part and a wireless connection with the phone. To make the project I used Python and Thonny IDE for programming the Raspberry PI and for the mobile application I used Android Studio with Java."
